    <h1>About This App</h1>
    <p>
        I made this page to learn how to build an app using Angular. This project allowed me to explore the fundamentals of Angular, including components, services, routing, state management, and making HTTP client requests. It has been a great opportunity to practice building a dynamic and interactive web application while learning best practices for modern web development.
